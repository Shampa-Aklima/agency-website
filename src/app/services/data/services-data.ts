          question: "Is digital marketing only for big companies?",
          answer: "Digital marketing is highly scalable and can be tailored to any budget. Small businesses often see better ROI due to more targeted, focused campaigns and the ability to compete on creativity rather than just budget."

          question: "Do I need to be on every social media platform?",
          answer: "Quality over quantity is key. It's better to have a strong presence on 2-3 platforms where your audience is active rather than spreading thin across all platforms. We help identify the right channels for your business."
